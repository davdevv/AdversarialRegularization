# Adversarial Regularization for Convolution Filters

## Project Description

Discriminators in GAN learning helps to distinguish real images from generated. Also we know that convolution filters are 2D matrices. If we train the model on the large amount of data we will see that filters have some patterns. However, if we train the model on the small data, the filters looks random even after training. 
The question is: *Can we apply discriminator to regularize the new filters while training on small data?*
